Ada has a Mushroom fluffy, and she wanted to have a game about her and her Mushroom fluffy, so this game was created.

Ada's original idea was that she would explore the forest and encounter mushrooms of different colors. After discussing with Daddy, her idea gradually improved.
1. She explores the forest and encounters a series of mushrooms running towards her;
If they are red, she will lose one point if she encounters them,
If they are gold, she will gain three points if she encounters them.

2. She can jump to avoid red mushrooms.

3. Her jumps can be unrestricted by trees, but if she encounters three red mushrooms in a row, her jumps will be blocked by trees; if she encounters two gold mushrooms in a row, her jumps can be restored to being unblocked by trees.

4. If you get 30 points, you can get a bomb; using the bomb, you can clear all red mushrooms on the current screen and restore the ability to jump unblocked.

5. The first version runs in the browser.

6. Use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to control the character to move horizontally; use the up arrow key to jump.

7. The character Ada is represented by the letter A, the red mushroom is represented by the red M, the golden mushroom is represented by the golden M; the tree is represented by the T. The grass under the feet is represented by green.

8. The background of the scene is gray-green.



Ada's daddy also gave some ideas on how to realize this game, including,

1. Complete this game with the help of Claude Artifact.

2. Add background music and game sound effects.

3. Publish it on the Internet so that friends can play it.

4. Gradually improve, including adding scoreboards, chats, enriching game features and content, and publishing mobile apps.

5. Help Ada realize her ideas through practical operations.
